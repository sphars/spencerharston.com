## Doing

I purchased a couple IOT devices, some smart plugs and bulbs. I recently set up a new Raspberry Pi 5 with Home Assistant, so I'm setting up my self-hosted smart home ecosystem.

## Learning

Not doing a lot in this regard specifically, but I have bookmarked some pages that I want to follow-up on.

## Reading

_Sourdough_ by Robin Sloan

_See also my [year-to-date page](/posts/2024/books-of-2024/) about what else I've read this year._

## Watching

Started watching _Killing Eve_. A few episodes in, I like it so far.

## Playing

I finished the main story of _Horizon: Zero Dawn_ and started the Frozen Wilds DLC. Definitely  my GOTY.

_Slay the Spire_ is my current fallback whenever I want to play something but don't want to start anything new.
