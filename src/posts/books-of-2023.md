Is it cliché to set a goal to read more books at the start of the new year? Yes. Am I doing it anyways? Also yes. I haven't decided on a set number of books to read, I simply wanted to read more this year.

The following is a list of books I'm currently reading, have finished, decided to not continue (for one reason or another), and potential books. 

Links are to the Goodreads entry or other relevant source for the book.

## Finished Reading
* [I'm Glad My Mom Died](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59364173-i-m-glad-my-mom-died) by Jennette McCurdy ⭐
* [How to Take Over the World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58446218-how-to-take-over-the-world) by Ryan North ⭐
* [Born a Crime](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29780253-born-a-crime) by Trevor Noah ⭐
* [Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28881.Lamb) by Christopher Moore

Generally speaking, if I finished a book, that means it was enjoyable enough for me to, well, finish it. However, a ⭐ means the book is recommended, and I think you should read it too.
