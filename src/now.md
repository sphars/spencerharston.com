## Doing
Recently reorganized this website. A lot of things were cleaned up, but some little bugs snuck in so I'm cleaning those up. Plus looking at more ways to automate or optimize the build. Ran into an issue with 11ty v3 so sticking with 2.0.1 for now^[v3 is currently alpha so I'm keeping an eye on its progress.].

Fixing my sprinklers. Too many have become the victim of an aggressive lawn mower, and it's time to do something about it.

## Reading
Working through the audiobooks of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, currently in *The Fellowship of the Ring*. Andy Serkis is the narrator, and boy does he do a fantastic job.

Also reading *Zero Days* by Ruth Ware. The theme seemed like something up my alley, having enjoyed listening to many episodes of the *Darknet Diaries* podcast. It's an... okay book so far. At least it's an easy read.

*See also my [year-to-date page](/posts/2024/books-of-2024/) about what else I've read this year.*

## Watching
This is an odd decision by me, but *Young Sheldon*. I used to watch (and enjoy) *The Big Bang Theory* in high school, until my interest died^[The humor was a little too cringe, but honestly, I think it was the laugh track that did it in for me. Can't believe it went on for as many seasons as it did.]. Recently added to Netflix, decided to give it a shot as I needed a easy, half-hour show that I didn't need to pay strict attention to.

## Playing
Recently picked up *Jedi: Fallen Order* in a recent Steam sale, so I've started that. I am not very, uh, good at these types of games^[I think it's considered a Souls-like game, at least according to the Steam tags.], so the difficulty slider is turned way down. Don't judge me. I'm here for the story anyways.

*Slay the Spire* is my current fallback whenever I want to play something but don't want to start anything new.
