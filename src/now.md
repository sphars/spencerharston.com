## Doing

I'm creating a fairly simple application to generate math worksheets in the browser, using Typescript and Vite. I also found a neat CSS library to make it look like Windows 98 for those nostalgic vibes. The app is working well currently. There is one more feature I'd like to get in and then I'll consider it v1.0. It's live at [mathsheets.net](https://www.mathsheets.net)

I'm also working on a dead simple web app to generate images of Mastodon posts. Sometimes I want to share an image of a post/status/toot/whatever they're called, and screen-shotting and cropping is not ideal. This will use the Mastodon API. It's at the MVP stage now, everything is done client-side. I'm considering creating an API to do this backend, because CORS is a pain. It can be my first SaaS (screenshots as a service)!

## Learning

Been thinking about a possible application I want to create to meet my specific needs. I want to make a simple, multi-platform note-taking app^[I know, I know, these apps are a dime-a-dozen]. Markdown only, very little organization, simple rules and layout. No idea where to start except researching the best stack and start somewhere. In the meantime, I'm working on customizing VS Code specifically for note-taking, since it's already pretty good at notes as is.

While the little app I'm creating above (the math worksheets one) is using Typescript and Vite, I still want to learn a proper framework. Perhaps I can convert this to something (possibly Vue), but honestly that might be overkill. Can't hurt though.

## Reading

Trying out another light-hearted book _Zero Stars, Do Not Recommend_. Looked interesting, or at least similar to other books I've enjoyed.

_See also my [year-to-date page](/posts/2024/books-of-2024/) about what else I've read this year._

## Watching

It's October, and that means a new season of _The Great British Baking Show_.

My wife and I are watching the new Kristen Bell show on Netflix, _Nobody Wants This_. Two episodes in, and honestly, I find it pretty great.

Final season of _The Umbrella Academy_ dropped a few weeks ago, so I'm finishing that up.

I'm also on the hunt for the adaptations of some of the book I read (namely _Under the Dome_) but I may just have to shell out for a temporary subscription to some random streaming site.

## Playing

I'm playing _Descenders_ for scratching that "just have some fun" itch.

I started _Horizon: Zero Dawn_ a couple days ago (and yes, I'm playing on easy difficulty). It runs beautifully on my [Linux PC](/posts/2024/building-a-new-pc-in-2024/).

_Slay the Spire_ is my current fallback whenever I want to play something but don't want to start anything new.
