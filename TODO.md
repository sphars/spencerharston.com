# TODO:

- Fix metadata loading in templates (e.g. copyright year and social media links)
- Fix commit link in /about
- Fix metadata in `<meta>` tags
- Test production build with meta image generation
- Cleanup repo files
- Cleanup code (comments, etc.)

Compare metadata with prod version. RSS feed seems okay
