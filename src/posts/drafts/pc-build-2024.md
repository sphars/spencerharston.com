I've been PC user for most of my life. My first experiences with computers was in the late 1990s, using Windows 3.1. It wasn't until I was in college that I was able to build my own PC for the first time. It was a very fun and rewarding experience. Now it's time to build another PC in 2024. Here's my experience of picking new parts, building the PC, and thoughts about the process in general. 

## The Quarter-Life Crisis PC

First, some background on my previous custom PC.

Back in early 2016, I was going through what I called my quarter-life crisis. I had just ended a relationship, I was a sophomore in college, and I felt a bit down in the dumps. Best solution I had to fix this: spend a lot of money and build a new PC. That became my first PC that I put together, and on a college budget, I feel I did a decent job with the parts I used. I dubbed it the *Quarter-Life Crisis PC* (QLC) because life is short. Here's a breakdown of that PC:

Total price in 2016 was around $820 (I think). On a college budget, I think I did pretty good.

I did make a few upgrades since the initial build:

- RAM: doubled from 8 GB to 16 GB
- Storage: added a second 500 GB SSD I had lying around
- PSU: The fan in my original PSU died (it was a Corsair low-tier something or other) so I upgraded to a SeaSonic PSU
- Monitor: upgraded to a 1440p 75Hz Lenovo monitor I got for cheap, from a basic 1080p monitor
- Keyboard: upgraded to a mechanical keyboard. A CoolerMaster MasterKeys Pro L, on the cheaper end of mech keyboards, but effective

### Operating System
For the OS, I started with Windows 7 then upgraded Windows 10 when it was available (8 was garbage, of course). I also ran Pop!_OS on it for a couple months, just to try it out. Since Microsoft has decided to not allow that generation of CPUs to run Windows 11, end-of-life for 10 was coming soon.

I loved this PC, it's done so well for me the last eight years. The CPU/GPU combo was a champ, and though AMD ended support for that generation of GPUs (last driver update was in 2022), it still worked for my needs through 2024. The game I played the most was Rocket League and it ran quite well. The hardware is still good, and I'm thinking about what I can do with it now.

## New Year, New PC
Fast-forward to 2024. The QLC PC still worked decently enough, but I was starting to notice some slow-downs and other signs of "old age". And with the looming deadline of Windows 10, I was itching to try out some Linux distros (more on that below). What better way to try them out than to build a brand new PC?

Total price I paid in early 2024 was around $1500, not including the monitor.

#### Case: Fractal Design Meshify 2 Mini
The case is what started all this. Out of the blue last year, my brother-in-law asked me about PC components and what kind of case and size I'd pick. I mentioned Micro ATX is what I'd aim for, though I'd love a Mini ITX if the budget allowed it. I thought he was asking advice for himself. Turns out, he was planning on gifting me a case for Christmas, and this is the one he picked! Once I saw the case in-person, I just had to get everything else and get to building.

Overall, the case has been a pleasure to build in, with a couple minor tweaks to make it better for my needs. There's plenty of space for the components I picked, no tools are needed to access everything, the top panel is removable, it has very good airflow, and the clean, minimal design is perfect for me. My only wishes were that the front panel audio cable was just a little bit shorter (pins on my motherboard were about as far away as possible) and the space between the back panel and chassis needed to be extended by a millimeter or two. It came with a couple fans, but I removed them and added five fans of my own (two intake, two top exhaust, one rear exhaust).

#### CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 7700X
One of my first requirements for a new PC was to go Team Red. I've had no issues with AMD CPUs in other computers (like my ThinkPad), and I knew that Linux support would be solid. It also helped that I got a good deal on this CPU by having Best Buy price match Microcenter. Sure wish Microcenter would come to Utah...

I haven't fully benchmarked the CPU but it has taken everything I've thrown at it so far and handled it like a champ. With the cooler I added, temps have been perfectly fine (upper 30s/low 40s at idle, upper 70s/low 80s at full use). Considered going for a water-cooled system but I decided to keep things simple and less-expensive. No complaints here.

#### GPU: AMD Radeon 7800XT
As strong Linux compatibility would be a requirement on this build, I knew right away I was sticking with AMD. The QLC PC was also an AMD card (Radeon 380) and I never had any issues with it in the eight years of use. Not only that, the price-to-performance ratio at 1440p was better than comparable Nvidia cards, so AMD is the obvious choice. Decided to go with the Sapphire model, which is essentially the AMD reference model. No flashiness here, but it fits in well with my minimalistic aesthetic I was going for in this build.

This card has been a great choice for me. Every game I've played so far has been able to run on max or near-max settings. Here's some quick stats on a few games I've tried so far:

- Doom (2016): max settings, 200 FPS (capped) @ 1440p
- Firewatch: max settings, 230-240 FPS @ 1440p
- Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2: TODO: get these stats cause I don't remember
- Helldivers 2: high-max settings, 120-140 FPS @ 1440p 
  - My settings could use some tweaking, since I'm running it on Linux. Plus it's still being optimized by the developers

My only minor issue with the specific model of card I received is that there's a bit of coil whine when under 100% usage. Not a big deal to me, but other models may fare better. I do wish I had waited a month for a better card (more below). Overall though, I think this card will suit me just fine for the next 4+ years.

#### Motherboard: ASRock B650M PG RIPTIDE WIFI Micro ATX
The motherboard was the component that I had a tough time deciding on. There were three motherboards I was looking into, one from MSI, Gigabyte and ASRock. All three had features that I was interested in and were priced about the same. The reviews were very similar to one another, but of course each had their pros and cons. In the end, I felt like the ASRock edged out just *slightly* above the others and so that's the one I picked.

The ASRock motherboard has been a good choice. Honestly, there's not much to say about it. It works well, has plenty of features, like the ability to use PCI Gen 5 for an m.2 drive and Wi-Fi 6E. It has one RGB feature under the south bridge heatsink, which I currently keep at a static white, and four SATA connectors, but I'm not going to be using that many SATA devices anyways. So far so good.

#### Monitor: LG UltraGear 27GR83Q-B
I was not planning on buying a new monitor to go with this build. It would've put me way over budget for anything decent. So when I saw this go on sale at Best Buy, I looked to see if I could squeeze it in. Two things made that happen. First, Best Buy had a promotion going on that gave 10% off any new LG monitor by recycling any monitor. My original Asus monitor from the QLC build was finally ready to retire. Second, I was able to use my work rewards and turn them into Best Buy gift cards, which would cover nearly the remainder of the cost. In the end, I spent less than $10 out of pocket to get this. Not bad at all.

This monitor is a 27" 1440p 240Hz IPS display and doesn't disappoint. I actually bought a ultrawide VA display before this, but the black smearing bothered me too much. I'm not a monitor enthusiast, I just need one that looks good. After having experienced 240Hz refresh rate with this, I can never go back. I would've loved to get an OLED monitor, but again, the budget can't handle it. Next time though!

#### Other Parts
Don't have much to say about everything else that went into this build. I went with 32 GB of RAM and enabled the EXPO settings on it. I replaced all the stock fans in the case with five Arctic fans. The cooler is beefy but handles well (and the design fits very nicely). I spent a little extra to get some power cable extensions to get that clean look on my cables. A little vain, and it's hard to see behind the glass, but they look very nice. 

#### Tracking the Prices
I spent the month of January pricing out and collecting all the parts for the build. I used these tools and sites to help me purchase them

- PCPartPicker's price tracking and notification for price thresholds
- CamelCamelCamel for Amazon tracking
- Best Buy price matching
- slickdeals.net RSS feeds for random deals on PC parts
- The r/buildapcsales subreddit (via RSS feed) for user-posted deals

By waiting and using these sites, I managed to score a few deals and stay within my budget of around $1500. The SSD in particular hit a low price one of the weeks then proceeded to never hit that price again since. My one regret is that I did not remove the r/buildapcsales feed from my RSS reader. Shortly after the AMD 7900 GRE was released earlier this year, it went on sale one time for the same price I paid for the 7800XT card. If I had waited a month, that is the card I would've chosen. Alas.

### The Operating System: The Nobara Project
Windows has completely gone downhill since 11 was released. The ads, the bloat, AI shoved into every corner, and the general user-hostile experiences (aka [enshittification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification))^[This recent [article from The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/21/24063379/windows-11-ads-bing-edge-cruft) sums it up nicely.] have completely turned me off of installing it on this new PC. It was time to give Linux another go.

I explored my options before building the PC, and a few distros piqued my interest: Pop!_OS, Mint, Zorin, Garuda, Debian, some random Arch flavors, and Fedora. Then I came across the [Nobara Project](). This distro is built by the same person who has maintained a fork of Valve's Proton project to add fixes and various enhancements. Nobara includes that Proton fork and various other drivers, packages, and enhancements to make it easier to game out of the box. Plus it's built on the Fedora project, with the KDE desktop, which meant a rolling release of packages and kernels. Since my hardware is rather new, I was willing to try the latest.

Overall, it has been a decent experience. Driver support is good, the KDE desktop is fantastic, and gaming has generally worked well. There has been a few  issues pop-up, which some have been addressed by updates. One particular area I'm still working on fixing is that my PC has problems when a second monitor is plugged in and enabled. Sometimes it refuses to go into low-power mode (screens won't go into or stay in standby) and it'll wake from sleep on its own. There was also a period where the OS would crash after logging in with the second monitor enabled, and only a hard reboot would get it working again. I've since left the second monitor disabled unless I'm actively using it. Not sure if it's a software or hardware issue, I need to spend more time investigating.

Nobara is a gaming-oriented distro, and with the work that's gone into Proton, gaming has been a good experience. It has taken a bit of trial-and-error to find the right settings and launch parameters (especially for Helldivers 2), but huge shoutout to [ProtonDB](https://www.protondb.com/) and the user reports to find settings that work well.

I should write up a separate post about my experience with this OS, but suffice to say that I recommend giving Nobara a try, or any distro, because learning and troubleshooting is fun!^[From a certain point of view.]

### Gallery
- get some good pics

### POST-BUILD THOUGHTS
- would've liked to wait 1-2 months for the 7900 GRE...
- still wouldn't have minded going for a mini-ITX build...
- OS has been good (with caveats)...

## RETIRING THE OLD PC
- what to do with it
- where to put it
- too much power draw for a server?
- kids PC?

## THE FUTURE
- Another 8 years to go
