I decided this year to look back on the stuff I've read, watched, played, or listened to. While not everything I've consumed is listed here, I did want to point out some items that I enjoyed. No full reviews here, I prefer simple lists and quick thoughts. Gives me an excuse for another blog post at least.

## Books
