Is it clich√© to set a goal to read more books at the start of the new year? Yes. Am I doing it anyways? Also yes. I haven't decided on a firm number of books to read, I just wanted to read more this year.

The following is a list of books I'm currently reading, have finished, decided to not continue (for one reason or another), and potential books. Links are to the Goodreads entry for the book.
