## Doing

I'm creating a fairly simple application to generate math worksheets in the browser, using Typescript and Vite. I also found a neat CSS library to make it look like Windows 98 for those nostalgic vibes. The app is working well currently. There is one more feature I'd like to get in and then I'll consider it v1.0. It's live at [mathsheets.net](https://www.mathsheets.net)

I'm also working on a dead simple web app to generate images of Mastodon posts. Sometimes I want to share an image of a post/status/toot/whatever they're called, and screen-shotting and cropping is not ideal. This will use the Mastodon API. It's at the MVP stage now, everything is done client-side. I'm considering creating an API to do this backend, because CORS is a pain. It can be my first SaaS (screenshots as a service)!

## Learning

Not doing a lot in this regard specifically, but I have bookmarked some pages that I want to follow-up on.

## Reading

A thriller, _I Remember You_ by Brian Freeman.

_See also my [year-to-date page](/posts/2024/books-of-2024/) about what else I've read this year._

## Watching

Still keeping up with the new season of _The Great British Baking Show_.

Started watching _Killing Eve_. A few episodes in, I like it so far.

For that comedy itch, I came across _Detroiters_. Why haven't I watched any Tim Robinson before?

## Playing

I'm about halfway through _Horizon: Zero Dawn_. I am in awe of how beautiful it is, even with it being six years old. Likely my GOTY.

_Slay the Spire_ is my current fallback whenever I want to play something but don't want to start anything new.
