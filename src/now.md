*This is a [/now page](https://nownownow.com/about) and was last updated on {{ updated | dateByFormat("MMMM d, y") }}.*

## Doing
Recently reorganized this website. A lot of things were cleaned up, but some little bugs snuck in so I'm cleaning those up. Plus looking at more ways to automate or optimize the build.

Fixing my sprinklers. Too many have become the victim of an aggressive lawn mower, and it's time to do something about it.

## Reading
Working through the audiobooks of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, currently in *The Fellowship of the Ring*. The audiobooks are the ones narrated by Andy Serkis, and he does a fantastic job.

Also reading *Zero Days* by Ruth Ware. The theme seemed like something up my alley, having enjoyed listening to many episodes of the *Darknet Diaries* podcast. It's an... okay book so far. At least it's an easy read.

*See also my [year-to-date page](/posts/2024/books-of-2024/) about what else I've read this year.*

## Watching
Wrapping up the final available episodes of *Brooklyn Nine-Nine* that are available on Netflix. Considering what next to watch, if anything.

## Playing
Recently picked up *Jedi: Fallen Order* in a recent Steam sale, so I've started that. I am not very, uh, good at these types of (Souls-like?) games, so the difficulty slider is turned way down. Don't judge me.

*Slay the Spire* is my current fallback whenever I want to play something but don't want to start anything new.
