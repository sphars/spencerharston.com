## Doing

I purchased a couple IOT devices, some smart plugs and bulbs. I recently set up a new Raspberry Pi 5 with Home Assistant, so I'm setting up my self-hosted smart home ecosystem.

## Learning

Not doing a lot in this regard specifically, but I have bookmarked some pages that I want to follow-up on.

## Reading

_Extra Focus: The Quick Start Guide to Adult ADHD_ by Jesse J. Anderson

_The Way of Kings_ by Brandon Sanderson. Slowly working through this one, but so far so good.

_See also my [/books page](/books/) for all my reading activity._

## Watching

Nothing really interesting at the moment, but I have been sticking re-runs of _Pawn Stars_ in the background.

## Playing

Currently about halfway through _Spider-Man Remastered_ on PC.

_Slay the Spire_ is still my current fallback whenever I want to play something but don't want to start anything new.
