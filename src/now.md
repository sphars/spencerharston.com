## Doing

I'm creating a fairly simple application to generate math worksheets in the browser. I wanted to learn some modern build tools, so I ended up going with Typescript and Vite. The app is working well currently, have some more features and minor bugs to work out. I get around to it when I have time.

## Learning

Been thinking about a possible application I want to create to meet my specific needs. I want to make a simple, multi-platform note-taking app^[I know, I know, these apps are a dime-a-dozen]. Markdown only, very little organization, simple rules and layout. No idea where to start except researching the best stack and start somewhere. In the meantime, I'm working on customizing VS Code specifically for note-taking, since it's already pretty good at notes as is.

While the little app I'm creating above (the math worksheets one) is using Typescript and Vite, I still want to learn a proper framework. Perhaps I can convert this to something (possibly Vue), but honestly that might be overkill. Can't hurt though.

## Reading

I'm working through the audiobooks of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, currently listening to *The Two Towers*. Andy Serkis is the narrator, and he do a fantastic job.

Gonna take a short break from fiction and go with some non-fiction. Picked out *My Friend Anne Frank* as my current book. 

*See also my [year-to-date page](/posts/2024/books-of-2024/) about what else I've read this year.*

## Watching

This is an odd decision by me, but *Young Sheldon*. I used to watch (and enjoy) *The Big Bang Theory* in high school, until my interest died^[The humor was a little too cringe, but honestly, I think it was the laugh track that did it in for me. Can't believe it went on for as many seasons as it did.]. Recently added to Netflix, decided to give it a shot as I needed a easy, half-hour show that I didn't need to pay strict attention to.

I've also been watching older movies I haven't seen yet, just as something to watch while I do some exercising. Going through the *Beverly Hills Cop* series right now.

## Playing

Recently picked up *Jedi: Fallen Order* in a recent Steam sale, so I've started that. I am not very, uh, good at these types of games^[I think it's considered a Souls-like game, at least according to the Steam tags.], so the difficulty slider is turned way down. Don't judge me. I'm here for the story anyways.

*Slay the Spire* is my current fallback whenever I want to play something but don't want to start anything new.
