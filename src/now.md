## Doing

I purchased a couple IOT devices, some smart plugs and bulbs. I recently set up a new Raspberry Pi 5 with Home Assistant, so I'm setting up my self-hosted smart home ecosystem.

## Learning

Not doing a lot in this regard specifically, but I have bookmarked some pages that I want to follow-up on.

## Reading

_Extra Focus: The Quick Start Guide to Adult ADHD_ by Jesse J. Anderson

It's going to take a while, but I started _The Way of Kings_ by Brandon Sanderson. Hope I like it enough to see it through.

_See also my [year-to-date page](/posts/2024/books-of-2024/) about what else I've read this year._

## Watching

Started watching _Killing Eve_. A few episodes in, I like it so far.

Also _Man on the Inside_ on Netflix.

## Playing

I finally finished _Horizon: Zero Dawn_, including the DLC. Probably won't do NG+, for now. Next up, either _Spider-Man Remastered_ or _LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga_.

_Slay the Spire_ is my current fallback whenever I want to play something but don't want to start anything new.
