Is it cliché to set a goal to read more books at the start of the new year? Yes. Am I doing it anyways? Also yes. I haven't decided on a set number of books to read, I simply wanted to read more this year.

The following is a list of books I'm currently reading, have finished, decided to not continue (for one reason or another), and potential books. 

Links are to the Goodreads entry or other relevant source for the book.

## Currently Reading
* [The Count of Monte Cristo](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7126.The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo) by Alexandre Dumas
* [Permanent Record](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46223297-permanent-record) by Edward Snowden

## Finished Reading
Generally speaking, if I finish a book, it means the book was enjoyable enough for me to, well, finish it. A ⭐ means the book is recommended, and I think you should read it too.
