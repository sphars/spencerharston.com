## Doing

I recently purchased my first record player, so I'm getting into that hobby now (see my [post](/posts/2025/starting-a-records-collection) about it).

## Learning

Not doing a lot in this regard specifically, but I have bookmarked some pages that I want to follow-up on.

## Reading

And once again, continuing Brandon Sanderson's Stormlight Archive series with #4, _Rhythm of War_.

_See also my [/books page](/books/) for all my reading activity._

## Watching

Looking into several options, like _Orphan Black_ now that it's on Netflix. Some days wish I opted for an Apple TV subscription, they've got lots I'm interested in.

As always, finishing the latest season of _The Great British Baking Show_.

## Listening

The real-time listening, thanks to Last.fm:

## Playing

Still working through _Fallout 4_, decided to follow a walkthrough so that I could keep focus on the next thing to do. Probably about half-way done with everything.

Giving _Balatro_ a go on my Steam Deck. Managed to win my third round!

_Slay the Spire_ is still my current fallback whenever I want to play something but don't want to start anything new.
