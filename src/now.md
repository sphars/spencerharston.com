## Doing

I recently purchased my first record player, so I'm getting into that hobby now (see my [post](/posts/2025/starting-a-records-collection) about it).

## Learning

Not doing a lot in this regard specifically, but I have bookmarked some pages that I want to follow-up on.

## Reading

_Extra Focus: The Quick Start Guide to Adult ADHD_ by Jesse J. Anderson. I literally am procrastinating finishing this...

_All Systems Red_ by Martha Wells. I've heard nothing but good things about this series.

_Words of Radiance_ (book 2 of The Stormlight Archive) by Brandon Sanderson. Given the length of this series, need to keep it going so I don't give up on it.

_See also my [/books page](/books/) for all my reading activity._

## Watching

Nothing particularly notable at the moment...

## Playing

Still working on _LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga_. Much bigger of a game since last playing any LEGO Star Wars game, no way I'm going to 100% this one, but I'll get through the story.

Giving _Balatro_ a go on my Steam Deck. Managed to win my third round!

_Slay the Spire_ is still my current fallback whenever I want to play something but don't want to start anything new.
