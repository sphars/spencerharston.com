I decided this year to look back on the stuf I've read, watched, played, or listened to. While not everything I've consumed was worth my time, I did want to point out some items that I enjoyed. No full reviews here, I prefer simple lists.

Gives me an excuse for another blog post at least.

## Books
See my full list of books in my [Books of 2023](/posts/books-of-2023) post.

## Movies and TV
I need to track this section better. last.fm has been great for tracking music, but I think I want to invest in one of those movie/TV tracking services. The following is from memory, and there's definitely more than what I've listed.

### Movies
* Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse
* Oppenheimer
* Barbie
* The Gray Man

### TV Shows
* Better Call Saul
* Blue Eye Samurai

* Ahsoka

## Games
Haven't played much this year, with having a new kid and all, but here are some games I enjoyed playing. This list would probably be half this if it wasn't for getting a Steam Deck.
* Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2
* Brotato
* Fallout 4
* Slay the Spire
