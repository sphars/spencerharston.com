## Doing

I'm creating a fairly simple application to generate math worksheets in the browser, using Typescript and Vite. I also found a neat CSS library to make it look like Windows 98 for those nostalgic vibes. The app is working well currently. There is one more feature I'd like to get in and then I'll consider it v1.0. It's live at [mathsheets.net](https://www.mathsheets.net)

I'm also working on a dead simple web app to generate images of Mastodon posts. Sometimes I want to share an image of a post/status/toot/whatever they're called, and screen-shotting and cropping is not ideal. This will use the Mastodon API. It's at the MVP stage now, everything is done client-side. I'm considering creating an API to do this backend, because CORS is a pain. It can be my first SaaS (screenshots as a service)!

## Learning

Been thinking about a possible application I want to create to meet my specific needs. I want to make a simple, multi-platform note-taking app^[I know, I know, these apps are a dime-a-dozen]. Markdown only, very little organization, simple rules and layout. No idea where to start except researching the best stack and start somewhere. In the meantime, I'm working on customizing VS Code specifically for note-taking, since it's already pretty good at notes as is.

While the little app I'm creating above (the math worksheets one) is using Typescript and Vite, I still want to learn a proper framework. Perhaps I can convert this to something (possibly Vue), but honestly that might be overkill. Can't hurt though.

## Reading

Currently reading *Under the Dome* (third Stephen King novel this year), longest book I've read this year so far.

*See also my [year-to-date page](/posts/2024/books-of-2024/) about what else I've read this year.*

## Watching

*Young Sheldon* is my current background show when I need something on. It's meh but good enough.

Also watching random movies on Netflix when I'm doing some exercising.

## Playing

Started playing some *Descenders* for scratching that "just have some fun" itch. Still want to try out *Horizon: Zero Dawn* at some point. I'll try and pick up *Risk of Rain 2* again, since it was just updated, possibly for the last time.

*Slay the Spire* is my current fallback whenever I want to play something but don't want to start anything new.
