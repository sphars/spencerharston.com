## Doing

I was recently given a 3D printer from a co-worker. With the help of my father, who has much more experience than I do, I've started printing things.

## Learning

Not doing a lot in this regard specifically, but I have bookmarked some pages that I want to follow-up on.

## Reading

Heard nothing but good things about it, so I'm currently reading _Dungeon Crawler Carl_ by Matt Dinniman.

_See also my [/books page](/books/) for all my reading activity._

## Watching

A friend suggested that the shows on Dropout would be right up my alley. And he was right! Currently working through _Gamechanger_ and others.

## Listening

Here's some real-time listening, thanks to Last.fm:

## Playing

Finally finished _Fallout 4_ so going through some of my backlog. _Tomb Raider_ (2013) is my current game, as well as _Megabonk_ on the Steam Deck.

_Slay the Spire_ is still my current fallback whenever I want to play something but don't want to start anything new.
