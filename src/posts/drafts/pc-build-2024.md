## INTRO
I've been PC user for most of my life, since my first PC back in the late 1990s, starting with Windows 3.1. It wasn't until I was in college that I was able to build a PC for the first time. It was a very fun and rewarding experience. But now it's time to build another PC in 2024. Here's my experience of picking new parts, building the PC, and thoughts about the process in general. 

## The Quarter-Life Crisis PC

Back in early 2016, I was going through what I called my quarter-life crisis. I had just ended a relationship, I was a sophomore in college, and I felt a bit down in the dumps. Best solution I had to fix this: spend a lot of money and build a new PC. That became my first PC that I put together, and on a college budget, I feel I did a decent job with the parts I used. I dubbed it the *Quarter-Life Crisis PC* because life is fun. Here's a breakdown of that PC:

I only made a few upgrades since the initial build:

- RAM: doubled from 8 GB to 16 GB
- Storage: added a second 500 GB SSD I had lying around
- PSU: The initial PSU fan died (it was a Corsair low-tier something) so I upgraded to a SeaSonic PSU
- Monitor: upgraded to a 1440p 75Hz Lenovo monitor I got for cheap, from a basic 1080p monitor
- Keyboard: upgraded to a mechanical keyboard. A CoolerMaster MasterKeys Pro L, on the cheaper end of mech keyboards, but effective

### PRICES
- Google Sheets to the rescue
- Oh to go back to these prices...

For the OS, that PC started with Windows 7, then Windows 10 (8 was garbage, of course). Unfortunately (fortunately?) Microsoft chose not to allow that generation of CPUs to run Windows 11, and end-of-life for 10 was coming soon.


I loved this PC, it's done so well for me the last eight years. The CPU/GPU combo was a champ, and though AMD ended support for that generation of GPUs (last driver update was in 2022), it still worked for my needs through 2024. The game I played the most was Rocket League and it ran quite well. 



## THE NEW BUILD
Fast-forward to 2024, and I felt it was time for a new PC. I was still using the above PC, and though I don't consider myself a "hardcore gamer", I was missing out on a few games that would not run well on that PC. 

- TL;DR: THE PCPP TABLE

### COMPONENTS

#### CASE

#### CPU

#### GPU
- AMD for sure...
- Picking a model that fits + brand...

#### MB
- Took the longest to decide which to get between the 3...

#### MONITOR
- Got a great deal, but next monitor splurge will be OLED...

#### OTHER
- Cable extensions
- Fans

### PRICES AND TRACKING
- budget was ~$1500 
- need to remove r/buildapcsales to not get that post-purchase regrets

### CHOOSING AN OS
- Because Windows 11 is terrible...
- This needs its own post...

### POST-BUILD THOUGHTS
- like waiting one more month for the 7900 GRE...
- still wouldn't have minded going for a mini-ITX build...
- OS has been good (with caveats)...

## RETIRING THE OLD PC
- what to do with it
- where to put it
- too much power draw for a server?

## THE FUTURE
- Another 8 years to go
