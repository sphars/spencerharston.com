Ever since my first class in web development, I wanted a personal website. I had the knowledge of creating a basic HTML page, could make it (relatively) pretty with CSS, and could even do some minor interactivity with JavaScript. As interesting as class projects were, they all lacked that personal touch. But thankfully that was just the beginning.

Life gets in the way. I got a job out of school (doing web development incidentally), got married, and moved on with life. But I've learned some things along the way. One of those things was building, hosting, and deploying a personal website, which is what you see here.

## Building This Website

There were several portions to getting this thing off the ground. And it all started with a domain.

### Domains

Now, it's true, you don't need a domain name to have a website. But how personal is it really when the URL for your own website is *someusername.squarespace.com* and owned by someone else? For a while, I was using GitHub pages to host some websites at my [sphars.github.io](https://sphars.github.io), but I had to get my own domain. Naturally, I wanted my own name, *spencerharston.com*, and wouldn't you know it, it was taken. I tried some other variations, but nothing else felt right. This was probably the main reason it took so long to get this site up and running. Patiently waiting (AKA forgetting about it), the *spencerharston.com* became available and I bought it.
