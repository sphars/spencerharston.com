## Doing

I was recently given a 3D printer from a co-worker. With the help of my father, who has much more experience than I do, I've started printing things.

## Learning

Not doing a lot in this regard specifically, but I have bookmarked some pages that I want to follow-up on.

## Reading

Between books right now, will resume in the new year. Probably going to start _Dungeon Crawler Carl_, based on the seemingly high praise for it.

I also strangely want to read _Moby Dick_, for some reason...

_See also my [/books page](/books/) for all my reading activity._

## Watching

Nothing particular of note at the moment. Haven't been as interested in anything as of late.

## Listening

Here's some real-time listening, thanks to Last.fm:

## Playing

Still working through _Fallout 4_. Nearly done with the main story, but working through the DLCs first. Though I'm really ready to move on to something else.

Giving _Balatro_ a go on my Steam Deck. Managed to win my third round!

_Slay the Spire_ is still my current fallback whenever I want to play something but don't want to start anything new.
