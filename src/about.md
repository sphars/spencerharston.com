_Hey! I'm Spencer_ ðŸ‘‹

I'm married to a wonderful wife and I'm father to the best two kids I could ask for (on most days). I currently reside in Ogden, UT and am currently employed as a software engineer at $COMPANY.

Outside of work, I'm collecting more games on Steam than I know what to do with. I also recently purchased my first record player so that's pretty cool.
