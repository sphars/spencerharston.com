## Doing
Recently reorganized this website. A lot of things were cleaned up, but some little bugs snuck in so I'm cleaning those up. Plus looking at more ways to automate or optimize the build. Ran into an issue with 11ty v3 so sticking with 2.0.1 for now^[v3 is currently alpha so I'm keeping an eye on its progress.].

## Learning
Been thinking about a possible application I want to create to meet my specific needs. I want to make a simple, multi-platform note-taking app^[I know, I know]. Markdown only, very little organization, simple rules and layout. No idea where to start except researching the best stack and start somewhere. In the meantime, I'm working on customizing VS Code specifically for note-taking, since it's already pretty good at notes as is.

I'm also considering a couple other minor projects, to try a new tech stack or to finally put something out there in "production". Mostly hobby stuff, but something to fulfill a need. Planning on learning some frontend framework to do this. Vue looks like the easiest one to jump into and get an MVP up and going.

## Reading
Working through the audiobooks of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, currently listening to *The Two Towers*. Andy Serkis is the narrator, and he do a fantastic job.

*See also my [year-to-date page](/posts/2024/books-of-2024/) about what else I've read this year.*

## Watching
This is an odd decision by me, but *Young Sheldon*. I used to watch (and enjoy) *The Big Bang Theory* in high school, until my interest died^[The humor was a little too cringe, but honestly, I think it was the laugh track that did it in for me. Can't believe it went on for as many seasons as it did.]. Recently added to Netflix, decided to give it a shot as I needed a easy, half-hour show that I didn't need to pay strict attention to.

## Playing
Recently picked up *Jedi: Fallen Order* in a recent Steam sale, so I've started that. I am not very, uh, good at these types of games^[I think it's considered a Souls-like game, at least according to the Steam tags.], so the difficulty slider is turned way down. Don't judge me. I'm here for the story anyways.

*Slay the Spire* is my current fallback whenever I want to play something but don't want to start anything new.
