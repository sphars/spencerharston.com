I finally did it, I purchased a record player.

I don't recall how long it's been, but for some time now I've wanted to own a record player. I can't give a specific reason either, but I've always wanted to try one out. Years ago, when this desire started, I didn't know anything about records and vinyl. To learn and get exposed to it all, I subscribed to the [r/vinyl](https://old.reddit.com/r/vinyl) subreddit. I've seen some pretty neat setups since then, and many record collections. It all just looked so neat!

My music listening habits aren't anything special, in my opinion, and I haven't really been the audiophile, full album-listening type. I just listen to songs I enjoy. The most investment I've put into any music-listening habit is being a YouTube Music subscriber for over a decade^[I subscribed to Google Play Music All Access, back in July 2013, when it only in beta. I'm still riding that sweet, sweet intro price of $7.99/month, and I get YouTube Premium as well. I hope it never gets discontinued.], and scrobbling my music listening since 2008^[This came as a direct result of learning what scrobbling is, thanks to installing [Rockbox](https://www.rockbox.org/) on my OG iPod nano back in high school].

I started looking at turntables not too long ago, getting a feel for decent, entry-level tables that wouldn't hurt financially, should I decide it wasn't for me. I was eyeing one of the Audio-Technicas that looked like a good introduction. A couple weeks ago, a deal appeared on Slickdeals that seemed pretty decent. It looked like a seller on eBay had a huge amount of inventory and was getting rid of brand new players and was accepting offers as low as $120. I thought about it, and decided that for $120, it was certainly worth a shot to see if this is a hobby I could get invested in. And so I bought it. I'm now the owner of a Como Audio (Pro-Ject T1) turntable.

## Unboxing and First Impressions

Having never owned a record player before, I was a bit surprised at the size of the player, a bit bigger than I imagined. Unpacking and set-up was straightforward, the instructions were minimal, but the player itself was playable out of the box. It's a nice-looking player, nothing fancy, a simple all-black design.

The only negative about the player was more of a QA issue. The dust cover that came with mine was warped, and didn't sit flat on the player itself, leaving a small noticeable gap. I contacted the seller, and thankfully they were able to send me a new cover that sits much more flush. Also it might just be my house but boy does it get dusty in the room (basement) that I have this set up in.

I, of course, had no records when I got the player. I asked my dad if he had any, because I remember seeing records of his growing up, but I don't remember what he had (other than some Star Trek record). My dad said I wouldn't recognize any of the songs, but I didn't care, as I needed to test the player anyways. He gave me an Andy Williams LP, and I proved him wrong, I did know one of songs! It sounded fine, the record played and the turntable worked.

Sound-wise, I gotta be honest, I don't know what I'm listening for as far as quality goes. It sounds fine to me? There's some static but that could be the records causing that since some records are worse than others. My amp and speaker setup, again, nothing fancy, they seem adequate for the job and work as expected.

## My Setup

As mentioned, I'm completely new to the world of record players, but I do know that my equipment is on the low-end. I have no plans to upgrade until I've decided I'm using it enough to invest in something better.

- Player: Como Audio Turntable (Pro-Ject T1) in Piano Black
- Amp: RadioShack (Optimus) SA-155 Integrated Stereo Amplifier
- Speakers: Yamaha TODO bookshelf speakers

Currently in search of a decent, small cabinet to host everything in.

## My Record Collection So Far

Besides the one given to me by my dad, my first albums were a couple of records from the thrift store that looked like the least offensive to my ears. It hit up the record store as well later that day, but given the overwhelming amount of music, I picked up something nearly at random (I knew of the band but not much of their stuff). I also ordered a couple records online from my current favorite band, Metric. Not too shabby for a start.

Inspired by someone on the 11ty Discord, and myself, I of course have to start inventorying my record collection. Copying the layout of my [/books](/books) page, and creating a new JSON file, I added a new page to my website, [/records](/records). This one will differ from my books page, since I want to only catalog what I own, not keep track of the current status of my listening.

I'm also upgrading my [CLI](/posts/2025/managing-my-books-data) to handle both books and records, or potentially any media type.

My plans for expanding my collection is to start identifying albums I currently enjoy digitally, and to find the physical copy of it. I also want to explore other genres with this. I have a buddy that enjoys video game soundtracks on his record player, and I plan to look into those, plus other soundtracks and instrumental albums, such as jazz. I want to avoid my typical listening habits, other than for bands I enjoy no matter the medium. A goal I'd like to do is a new album every 1-2 months for now. Ogden has two indie record stores, so I'll definitely hit them up when I can.

I do hope I stick with this and find some good music to sit back and listen to. Check out my [last.fm profile](https://www.last.fm/user/spencer314) for my listening habits and if anyone has any recommendations, I'd love to take a look!
