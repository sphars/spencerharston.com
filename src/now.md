## Doing

I'm creating a fairly simple application to generate math worksheets in the browser, using Typescript and Vite. The app is working well currently, have one more feature I'd like to get in and then I'll consider it v1.0.

## Learning

Been thinking about a possible application I want to create to meet my specific needs. I want to make a simple, multi-platform note-taking app^[I know, I know, these apps are a dime-a-dozen]. Markdown only, very little organization, simple rules and layout. No idea where to start except researching the best stack and start somewhere. In the meantime, I'm working on customizing VS Code specifically for note-taking, since it's already pretty good at notes as is.

While the little app I'm creating above (the math worksheets one) is using Typescript and Vite, I still want to learn a proper framework. Perhaps I can convert this to something (possibly Vue), but honestly that might be overkill. Can't hurt though.

## Reading

I'm working through the audiobooks of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, currently listening to *The Return of the King*. Andy Serkis is the narrator, and he do a fantastic job.

Gonna take a short break from fiction and go with some non-fiction. Picked out *My Friend Anne Frank* as my current book. 

If I need something completely different to read, I picked out *Under the Dome* (third Stephen King novel this year).

*See also my [year-to-date page](/posts/2024/books-of-2024/) about what else I've read this year.*

## Watching

*Young Sheldon* is my current background show when I need something on. It's meh but good enough.

Also watching random movies on Netflix when I'm doing some exercising.

## Playing

Nearly done with *Jedi: Fallen Order*. It's taken a while but I only have so much time to play. I'm enjoying it though, will consider the sequel later on when it's a good deal.

*Slay the Spire* is my current fallback whenever I want to play something but don't want to start anything new.
